# TINY Language Compiler - Analyzer Phase

## Overview
This program implements the analyzer step of a custom compiler for the TINY programming language. The analyzer processes the parse tree generated by the scanning step and outputs the terminal (leaf) nodes of the parse tree to the terminal.

## Input
The program takes the path of a source code file written in the TINY programming language as input. An example input file, `input.txt`, is provided for testing.

## Output
The program outputs the terminal (leaf) nodes of the parse tree to the terminal. The number of spaces before each node represents the level on which the node relies on (the order of the rule the node represents in relation to the program node, which is level 0). Each level in the tree is 3 spaces apart from its predecessor.

## TINY Language Grammar Rules
- `program -> stmtseq`
- `stmtseq -> stmt { ; stmt }`
- `stmt -> ifstmt | repeatstmt | assignstmt | readstmt | writestmt`
- `ifstmt -> if expr then stmtseq [ else stmtseq ] end`
- `repeatstmt -> repeat stmtseq until expr`
- `assignstmt -> identifier := expr`
- `readstmt -> read identifier`
- `writestmt -> write expr`
- `expr -> mathexpr [ (<|=) mathexpr ]`
- `mathexpr -> term { (+|-) term }` (left associative)
- `term -> factor { (*|/) factor }` (left associative)
- `factor -> newexpr { ^ newexpr }` (right associative)
- `newexpr -> ( mathexpr ) | number | identifier`

## Build Instructions
To compile the program, use a C++ compiler. For example:

```bash
g++ tiny_analyzer.cpp -o tiny_analyzer
```

## Usage
Compile the program and run it from the command line. Provide the path to the TINY source code file as an argument:

```bash
./tiny_analyzer input.txt
```

## Example Input (input.txt)
```TINY
if x < y then
    temp := 20
else
    temp := 30
end;
```

## Example Output
```
[If]
   [Oper][LessThan]
      [ID][x]
      [ID][y]
   [Assign][temp]
      [Num][20]
```
